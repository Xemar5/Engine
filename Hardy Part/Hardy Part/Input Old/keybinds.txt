FUNCTION SYNTAX

1. keycode - look above
2. gamepad           	|| keyboard         	|| mouse
3. button / axis / hat 	|| key / *blank*    	|| button / relative...
4. #key no. (leave *blank* if 'mouse relative_x' or 'mouse relative_y') 
5. 	down / up / held 										 -  for keyboard
	down / up / held / unit / unit_negative / unit_positive / abs / abs_negative / abs_positive 	 -  for gamepad
	down / up / held / relative_x / relative_y							 -  for mouse
6(if 'held' used). #time (in miliseconds)
eg:
	x = mouse button 0
	laup = gamepad axis 1 unit_negative
	raright = mouse relative_x
* For mouse relative_x and relative_y, use them only once when binding to ra..., la... or d...
	(eg. raup			) <- leave empty
	(eg. radown = mouse relative_y	)
	(eg. raleft			) <- leave empty
	(eg. raright = mouse relative_x	)

* Keywords can be used in any order, but always start with KEYCODE and the equal sign (eg. start = 0 button gamepad down)
* Numbers are read from left to right (#key no. is always the first found number, #time (if used at all) is the second)
* For clarity, try to stick to the syntax used in above example (not sure if it unordered syntax works at all times)

* If decoder can't understand the input, the key will be set to null (no key asigned)
* If multiple arguments from the same point in FUNCTION SYNTAX are used, the key will be set to null (no key asigned)
	(eg. x = mouse gamepad ...    or    x = gamepad unit abs ...)
* Lack of any argument from any point from FUNCTION SYNTAX (except for *blank* options) results in key being set to null (no key asigned)
* Be careful about mistakes with underscore sign '_' missing 
	(eg. x = gamepad unit negative ...  - NOT AN ERROR ('unit' will be used instead of 'unit_negative'))
			     ^

* For #key in 4. and SDL replacement can be used (for gamepad axis, gamepad button and keyboard button - no replacement for mouse)
	(eg. x = keyboard key SDL_W down		)
	(eg. a = mouse button 0 up  			)
	(eg. raup = gamepad axis SDL_leftx unit_negative)


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
* Some SDL-type buttons for gamepad are mapped WRONG, that means, SDL_a is not always mapped to the actual A button
* If ths happens, user has to manually edit the keybinds (or this file) or try to match numeric key arguments (eg. button 7)
